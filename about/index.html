                <p>
                    I am a finance consultant and CFA Level I candidate with a
                    background in mechanical engineering. My passion lies in
                    building scalable valuation models, automating finance
                    workflows and translating complex data into actionable
                    insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years I have delivered global Oracle ERP Finance
                    implementations at Infosys, executed property valuations for
                    governmental clients and founded a startup during the COVID‑19
                    pandemic. These experiences taught me the value of rigour,
                    adaptability and long‑term thinking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My long‑term goal is to work at the intersection of fintech,
                    venture capital and hedge funds. I thrive on combining
                    analytical discipline with a sense of curiosity, and I draw
                    inspiration from archetypes like Ravana – not in mythological
                    reverence but as a symbol of intellect, conviction and the
                    courage to challenge convention.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside work, I enjoy writing about economics, markets and
                    policy; exploring new cultures; and refining my understanding
                    of emerging technologies. I’m always eager to connect with
                    like‑minded professionals and explore opportunities to make
                    finance smarter, more efficient and impactful.
